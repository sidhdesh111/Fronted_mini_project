# Frontend Mini Projects (JavaScript + HTML + CSS)

This repository contains **7 self-contained frontend mini projects** built using **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML5**, and **CSS3**. These projects are focused on learning core frontend concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, API interaction, and user interaction design — without relying on any frontend framework.

---

## 🚀 Projects Overview

### 1️⃣ Weather App (Fetch API)
- Fetches real-time weather data from a public API.
- Uses `fetch()` to make HTTP requests.
- Displays weather details dynamically on the frontend.
- Handles loading state and gracefully manages API errors.

---

### 2️⃣ Quiz Test App (with API and Error Handling)
- Loads MCQ questions from a public API.
- Uses `fetch()` with `async/await`, wrapped inside `try...catch` to handle failed API responses or timeouts.
- Prevents frontend crashes using fallback logic.
- Displays result after completing the quiz.
- Resilient and user-friendly error handling.

---

### 3️⃣ Toggle Button with Checkbox
- A simple UI toggle using a checkbox input.
- On click, it switches background color between red and green.
- Demonstrates basic state toggling and DOM style manipulation.

---

### 4️⃣ Draggable Div (Mouse Event Handling)
- A `div` container that users can drag across the screen.
- Uses `mousedown`, `mousemove`, and `mouseup` events to handle dragging.
- Implements a flag system to control drag state.
- Demonstrates how to manually implement draggable behavior without libraries.

---

### 5️⃣ Drag-and-Drop Between Lists
- Allows users to drag items from one list container to another.
- Uses native drag events: `dragstart`, `dragover`, `drop`, and `mouseup`.
- Highlights drop zones and transfers list elements cleanly.
- Great example of working with the HTML5 drag-and-drop API.

---

### 6️⃣ Custom Modal Window
- Builds a custom modal (popup) using pure HTML, CSS, and JS.
- Includes close button and outside click functionality to dismiss the modal.
- Great for understanding z-index, overlay handling, and state-driven UI.

---

### 7️⃣ Tic Tac Toe Game (X/O)
- Classic two-player tic tac toe game using pure JavaScript.
- Tracks moves, checks for win/tie conditions, and resets the board.
- Focus on DOM manipulation, game logic, and UI updates.

---
> Each folder contains an `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
